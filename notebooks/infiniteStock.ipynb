    "The error stack traces indicate that the issue is occurring during an SQLite database operation, specifically when trying to insert a new record into the database. The function call to `BasketItem.save()` is where the exception seems to originate. This method is part of the Sequelize ORM, which handles database operations for the OWASP Juice Shop application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some possible reasons for these errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Integrity**: The data being inserted might violate some integrity constraints such as unique keys, foreign keys, etc.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Database Lock**: SQLite is file-based and sometimes may have issues with concurrent writes, although this is less likely in a well-designed application.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Resource Limit**: SQLite has some limitations on resources, although hitting those in a typical test scenario is unlikely unless very large data sets are involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Application Logic**: There may be a bug in the application logic that constructs the SQL query, causing the database operation to fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Troubleshooting Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Check Constraints**: Examine the table schema to understand what constraints exist and ensure that the data being inserted adheres to those constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Examine the Data**: Check if the data being passed to `BasketItem.save()` is in the expected format and includes all required fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Database Logs**: SQLite itself does not offer much in the way of logging, but you could enable SQL logging in Sequelize to see exactly what SQL statements are being executed. This can be done by setting the `logging` option to `console.log` when initializing the Sequelize instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Server Logs**: Look at the application logs for more context on what might be causing the error. You may need to increase the log verbosity level if not enough information is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Debugging**: Use debugging tools or insert debugging statements into the code to trace the values and states during execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that you are working towards a cybersecurity pivot, understanding how to debug these types of issues could be valuable. Debugging is not just a development activity; it's also crucial for understanding how and why applications fail, which is key knowledge for any cybersecurity professional."
